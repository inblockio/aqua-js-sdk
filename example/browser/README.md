## Getting started.
-> This is react(typescript)  project using vite.
-> Ensure to go through the  `vite.config.js` , `polyfills.ts` and `types.d.ts`
-> why do we need polyfills, this is due to repositories such as `crypto-browserify` that need  some node modules such as `proccess` and `stream` to work.Unfortunately `crypto` module is a critical component of  `aquafier-js-sdk`
